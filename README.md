# Introduction to Deep Learning, Summer Semester 2025-2026

## 🧭 Course Values

1. **Collaborate To Win**: work as one united team and use your combined strengths and capabilities to learn as much as possible.
2. **Innovate To Grow**: be proactive - it's the responsibility of each one of us to find opportunities and improve the course and each other. I give feedback to you, you share feedback between each other, you give feedback to me.
3. **Delight Viewers**: publish what you've learned in social platforms, build eye-catching solutions with the intention of showing your work to future customers/recruiters.
4. **Safeguard Our Future**: if you feel you're treated unfairly or you want to discuss any other problem, don't wait - talk to me directly.
5. **Value Each Other**: treat each other (and me) with respect, trust and integrity. The people that surround you now, might be your future colleagues. Act as if your actions have eternal consequences.
6. **You Learn As Much As You Want**: take full responsibility for the authenticity of your code! If you cannot write it on your own, let's write it together. You're not expected to solve everything - solve as much as you like and together we'll solve the rest.

## 📘 Set up an environment for working with Jupyter Notebooks

Please follow the instructions in one of the following two folders:

1. [GuideForVisualStudioCode](./GuideForVisualStudioCode/) - for working in a local development environment.
2. [GuideForGoogleColab](./GuideForGoogleColab/) - for working using a remote Google Cloud session.

### Books

- If you are part of the Moodle class, you should have received more information about recommended books by Simo at the start of the semester.
- If you are part of the Moodle class, but haven't received anything, feel free to contact Simo via his email address.

## 💡 Don't be afraid to ask questions

> 📌 If you are struggling a lot with the tasks, don't hesitate to ask us for a `1-1 session` in-person or via Google Meet 😇!

and remember:

> He who asks a question is a fool for five minutes; he who does not ask a question remains a fool `forever`.

-Chinese Proverb

## 💬❓ Frequently asked questions

### I'm not in the Moodle class. What do I do?

Everything is ok. Just tell me or send me an email. I only need your faculty number.

### A friend of mine is not in the Moodle class. What do I do?

They have to come personally to me and tell me or send me an email with their faculty number.

### How will I be graded?

There will be two homeworks, an exam, a project defense and a discussion after the defense.

### What is "the discussion"?

- The discussion is done after the defense of the project on the date of the final exam.
- It forms **50%** of the final grade.
- If I'm available to tune in for the final, I'll be asking questions (some will be in an interview style) regarding the topics I've covered.
- Example questions:
  - Tell me everything you know about Transformers?
  - How can we deal with a model that is overfit?
  - What's an important step to do when splitting data for a classification problem?

### How will the sessions be led?

1. We clear up any administrative questions.
2. In some sessions, I'll start with laying out theoretical aspects which I deem are important to be discussed with the whole class.
3. I'll split you into teams of $2$ or $3$ people.
4. You start going through `notes.md` discussing the questions there and agreeing on their answers.
5. The team continues with the tasks for the current week.
6. As they solve them, I'm called to provide feedback.
7. Once your team is ready, you can leave.
8. If you don't have enough time during the session, you can continue solving the tasks in your free time outside of class.

We won't be taking a break after the first hour - every team decides when to take a break.

### What if I'm having difficulties with a task?

Option 1: You ask me in-person.

Option 2: We arrange a Google Meet.

Option 3: Skip these. Solve as much as you can. Write your idea for each of the tasks you couldn't solve: for each task answer the following questions in comments:

    1. What are you trying to do?
    2. Can you specify these behaviors using tests?
    3. Can you group these tests in specific functions and classes?
    4. Make the tests pass.

Then, you'll basically have a set of tasks that are solved and a set of tasks for which you've outlined what you want to do. You send these two sets over email.

### How can I get feedback for the solutions outside of class?

Send them over email: `s.e.hristov99@gmail.com`, using the chain we've already started in the beginning of the course.

### Is it mandatory to submit the solutions to the tasks?

No. Do it when you want to make sure that you have learned what is expected.

### If I submit all tasks to you and they're all correct do I get a bonus to my grades?

No. It means that I've approved the submitted code.

### If I do not submit any of the tasks, do I get punished?

No. The tasks are meant to help you, not to punish you.

### What do you suggest as the best approach to achieve the highest grade in all exams and homeworks?

1. Learn by doing, rather than listening.
2. Do not use code generators.
3. Go through `notes.md` for the current week.
4. Try to solve as much tasks as you can.
5. If you can't solve a task, skip it - continue with the rest.
6. After you've solved as much as you can, submit an email, highlighting what you tried and what your idea was.

### Can I use external help - previous year students / Gen AI?

No. If you send a friend to the gym on your behalf, would you expect to get stronger? The tasks are designed to be interesting for humans to solve - no consideration is made for whether AI can or cannot solve them. If you want practice prompting an AI, there are almost certainly better courses elsewhere designed with that in mind.
